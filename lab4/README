## Modified methods

- A passive mouse callback was added to save the mouse positive for object rendering
- The ptList was changed into a `vector<Point>`` because that is easier to work with than an array
- Pressing 'Z' will undo the last control point drawn, making it easier to draw things

## Cool features

- Use C0 continuity (do not press 'C')
- The curve drawn wraps around the screen, and mousing over parts of the curve will reveal
  a famous Shakespearean quote
